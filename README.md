# Explanation
The theme for this quarter's IEEE project was to create a home automation device.
Our group decided to pursue development of a home security system.

This system automates the home by automatically locking the door upon the user
exiting the house. The user can then use his/her phone or an NFC card to unlock the
door.

**Parts**
1. Arduino
2. IR Transmitter
3. IR Receiver
4. Servo Motor
6. NFC Sensor
5. Buzzers + Lights (for user feedback)

# Demonstration
Will be added once project is complete
